  <p>This is an almost minimal command-based live coding engine. Press the button to re-evaluate your code.
    This language allows you to specify a rhythmic pattern of beats by entering a space-separated list of times and pitches. 
    You can also include javascript computation in the values.
    As an example:
  </p>
  <p>1+1@220 2@220*2 1*3@270</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>New feature: Adding brackets</strong></p>
  <p>You can add brackets around certain sequences of notes that you'd like to play multiple times. For example:</p>
  <p>3@340 2[1@220 2@330] is equivalent to 3@340 1@220 2@330 1@220 2@330</p>
